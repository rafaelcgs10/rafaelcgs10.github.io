(** Prove the following claim, marking cases (and subcases) with
    bullets when you use [destruct]. *)

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars (andb_true_elim2)  *)
Theorem andb_true_elim2 : forall b c : bool,
  andb b c = true -> c = true.
Proof.
Admitted.

(** **** Exercise: 1 star (zero_nbeq_plus_1)  *)
Theorem zero_nbeq_plus_1 : forall n : nat,
  beq_nat 0 (n + 1) = false.
Proof.
Admitted.

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars (boolean_functions)  *)
(** Use the tactics you have learned so far to prove the following
    theorem about boolean functions. *)

Theorem identity_fn_applied_twice :
  forall (f : bool -> bool),
  (forall (x : bool), f x = x) ->
  forall (b : bool), f (f b) = b.
Proof.
Admitted.

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars, optional (andb_eq_orb)  *)
(** Prove the following theorem.  (Hint: This one can be a bit tricky,
    depending on how you approach it.  You will probably need both
    [destruct] and [rewrite], but destructing everything in sight is
    not the best way.) *)

Theorem andb_eq_orb :
  forall (b c : bool),
  (andb b c = orb b c) ->
  b = c.
Proof.
  (* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.
