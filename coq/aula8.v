Theorem nil_app : forall l:natlist,
  [] ++ l = l.
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

Theorem tl_length_pred : forall l:natlist,
  pred (length l) = length (tl l).
Proof.
  intros l. destruct l as [| n l'].
  - (* l = nil *)
    reflexivity.
  - (* l = cons n l' *)
    reflexivity.
Qed.

Theorem app_assoc : forall l1 l2 l3 : natlist,
  (l1 ++ l2) ++ l3 = l1 ++ (l2 ++ l3).
Proof.
  intros l1 l2 l3. induction l1 as [| n l1' IHl1'].
  - (* l1 = nil *)
    reflexivity.
  - (* l1 = cons n l1' *)
    simpl. rewrite -> IHl1'. reflexivity.
Qed.

Fixpoint rev (l:natlist) : natlist :=
  match l with
  | nil    => nil
  | h :: t => rev t ++ [h]
  end.

Example test_rev1:            rev [1;2;3] = [3;2;1].
Proof. reflexivity.  Qed.
Example test_rev2:            rev nil = nil.
Proof. reflexivity.  Qed.

Theorem rev_length_firsttry : forall l : natlist,
  length (rev l) = length l.
Proof.
  intros l. induction l as [| n l' IHl'].
  - (* l = [] *)
    reflexivity.
  - (* l = n :: l' *)
    (* This is the tricky case.  Let's begin as usual
       by simplifying. *)
    simpl.
    (* Now we seem to be stuck: the goal is an equality
       involving [++], but we don't have any useful equations
       in either the immediate context or in the global
       environment!  We can make a little progress by using
       the IH to rewrite the goal... *)
    rewrite <- IHl'.
    (* ... but now we can't go any further. *)
Abort.

Theorem app_length : forall l1 l2 : natlist,
  length (l1 ++ l2) = (length l1) + (length l2).
Proof.
  (* WORKED IN CLASS *)

  - (* l1 = nil *)
    reflexivity.
  - (* l1 = cons *)
    simpl. rewrite -> IHl1'. reflexivity.  Qed.

Theorem rev_length : forall l : natlist,
  length (rev l) = length l.
Proof.
  intros l. induction l as [| n l' IHl'].
  - (* l = nil *)
    reflexivity.
  - (* l = cons *)
    simpl. rewrite -> app_length, plus_comm.
