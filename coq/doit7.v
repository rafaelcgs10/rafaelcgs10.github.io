(** **** Exercise: 2 stars each one, optional (poly_exercises)  *)
(** Here are a few simple exercises, just like ones in the [Lists]
    chapter, for practice with polymorphism.  Complete the proofs below. *)

Theorem app_nil_r : forall (X:Type), forall l:list X,
  l ++ [] = l.
Proof.
  (* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.

Theorem app_assoc : forall A (l m n:list A),
  l ++ m ++ n = (l ++ m) ++ n.
Proof.
  (* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.

Lemma app_length : forall (X:Type) (l1 l2 : list X),
  length (l1 ++ l2) = length l1 + length l2.
Proof.
  (* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.
(** [] *)

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars each one, optional (more_poly_exercises)  *)
(** Here are some slightly more interesting ones... *)

Theorem rev_app_distr: forall X (l1 l2 : list X),
  rev (l1 ++ l2) = rev l2 ++ rev l1.
Proof.
  (* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.

Theorem rev_involutive : forall X : Type, forall l : list X,
  rev (rev l) = l.
Proof.
  (* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars, recommended (split)  *)
(** The function [split] is the right inverse of [combine]: it takes a
    list of pairs and returns a pair of lists.  In many functional
    languages, it is called [unzip].

    Fill in the definition of [split] below.  Make sure it passes the
    given unit test. *)

Fixpoint split {X Y : Type} (l : list (X*Y))
               : (list X) * (list Y)
  (* REPLACE THIS LINE WITH ":= _your_definition_ ." *). Admitted.

Example test_split:
  split [(1,false);(2,false)] = ([1;2],[false;false]).
Proof.
