(** Using the above proof that [<->] is symmetric ([iff_sym]) as
    a guide, prove that it is also reflexive and transitive. *)

  P <-> P.

(** **** Exercise: 1 star, recommended (dist_not_exists)  *)
(** Prove that "[P] holds for all [x]" implies "there is no [x] for
    which [P] does not hold."  (Hint: [destruct H as [x E]] works on
    existential assumptions!)  *)

Theorem dist_not_exists : forall (X:Type) (P : X -> Prop),

    disjunction. *)

(** **** Exercise: 4 stars (tr_rev_correct)  *)
(** One problem with the definition of the list-reversing function
    [rev] that we have is that it performs a call to [app] on each
    step; running [app] takes time asymptotically linear in the size
    of the list, which means that [rev] has quadratic running time.
    We can improve this with the following definition: *)

Fixpoint rev_append {X} (l1 l2 : list X) : list X :=
  match l1 with
  | [] => l2
  | x :: l1' => rev_append l1' (x :: l2)
  end.

Definition tr_rev {X} (l : list X) : list X :=
  rev_append l [].

(** This version is said to be _tail-recursive_, because the recursive
    call to the function is the last operation that needs to be
    performed (i.e., we don't have to execute [++] after the recursive
    call); a decent compiler will generate very efficient code in this
    case.  Prove that the two definitions are indeed equivalent. *)

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars (excluded_middle_irrefutable)  *)
(** Proving the consistency of Coq with the general excluded middle
    axiom requires complicated reasoning that cannot be carried out
    within Coq itself.  However, the following theorem implies that it
    is always safe to assume a decidability axiom (i.e., an instance
    of excluded middle) for any _particular_ Prop [P].  Why?  Because
    we cannot prove the negation of such an axiom.  If we could, we
    would have both [~ (P \/ ~P)] and [~ ~ (P \/ ~P)] (since [P]
    implies [~ ~ P], by the exercise below), which would be a
    contradiction.  But since we can't, it is safe to add [P \/ ~P] as
    an axiom. *)

Theorem excluded_middle_irrefutable: forall (P:Prop),
  ~ ~ (P \/ ~ P).
Proof.

(** **** Exercise: 5 stars, optional (classical_axioms)  *)
(** For those who like a challenge, here is an exercise taken from the
    Coq'Art book by Bertot and Casteran (p. 123).  Each of the
    following four statements, together with [excluded_middle], can be
    considered as characterizing classical logic.  We can't prove any
    of them in Coq, but we can consistently add any one of them as an
    axiom if we wish to work in classical logic.

    Prove that all five propositions (these four plus
    [excluded_middle]) are equivalent. *)
