(** **** Exercise: 3 stars (list_exercises)  *)
(** More practice with lists: *)

Theorem app_nil_r : forall l : natlist,
  l ++ [] = l.
Proof.
  (* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.

Theorem rev_app_distr: forall l1 l2 : natlist,
  rev (l1 ++ l2) = rev l2 ++ rev l1.
Proof.
  (* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.

Theorem rev_involutive : forall l : natlist,
  rev (rev l) = l.
Proof.
  (* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.

(** There is a short solution to the next one.  If you find yourself
    getting tangled up, step back and try to look for a simpler
    way. *)

Theorem app_assoc4 : forall l1 l2 l3 l4 : natlist,
  l1 ++ (l2 ++ (l3 ++ l4)) = ((l1 ++ l2) ++ l3) ++ l4.
Proof.
  (* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.

(** An exercise about your implementation of [nonzeros]: *)

Lemma nonzeros_app : forall l1 l2 : natlist,
  nonzeros (l1 ++ l2) = (nonzeros l1) ++ (nonzeros l2).
Proof.
  (* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.
(** [] *)

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars (beq_natlist)  *)
(** Fill in the definition of [beq_natlist], which compares
    lists of numbers for equality.  Prove that [beq_natlist l l]
    yields [true] for every list [l]. *)

Fixpoint beq_natlist (l1 l2 : natlist) : bool
  (* REPLACE THIS LINE WITH ":= _your_definition_ ." *). Admitted.

Example test_beq_natlist1 :
  (beq_natlist nil nil = true).
 (* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.

Example test_beq_natlist2 :
  beq_natlist [1;2;3] [1;2;3] = true.
(* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.

Example test_beq_natlist3 :
  beq_natlist [1;2;3] [1;2;4] = false.
 (* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.

Theorem beq_natlist_refl : forall l:natlist,
  true = beq_natlist l l.
Proof.
  (* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.
(** [] *)

(** **** Exercise: 4 stars, advanced (rev_injective)  *)
(** Prove that the [rev] function is injective -- that is,

    forall (l1 l2 : natlist), rev l1 = rev l2 -> l1 = l2.

(There is a hard way and an easy way to do this.) *)
